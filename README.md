# Windfire Restaurants UI
This repository holds the code for UI of my *Windfire Restaurants* management application, along with scripts, playbooks and configurations to automate application run and deployment to target infrastructures.

## Before you start
The *Windfire Restaurants UI* microservice of the application is developed using Angular technology; to test it locally, you need to install Angular on your workstation, follow the instructions at Angular website (*https://angular.io/guide/setup-local*) to setup Angular and all its prerequisites.

Before starting to use and test the application you also need to ensure all the dependencies for the application are installed, I provided *app-init.sh* scriot for your convenience, just run it and it will do it for you.
